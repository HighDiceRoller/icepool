## 0.2.2

* `best_set` now queries the `score_func` to determine possible outcomes, which allows more flexibility.

## 0.2.1

* `Die.align()` and `Die.trim()` are now public.
* Optimize `keep()` algorithm by skipping to results after passing the last kept die.
* Add `best_set()` method for computing sets of matching dice.

## 0.2.0

The major change in this version is a new roll-and-keep algorithm. This can keep arbitrary indexes, as well as supporting dissimilar dice as long as they share a common "prefix" of weights.
