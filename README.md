Python dice probability package.

[GitHub repository.](https://github.com/HighDiceRoller/icepool)

[PyPi page.](https://pypi.org/project/icepool/)

Try coding in your browser using [Icecup](https://highdiceroller.github.io/icepool/apps/icecup.html), a simple frontend for scripting and graphing similar to AnyDice, SnakeEyes, and Troll. You can find a series of tutorials [here](https://highdiceroller.github.io/icepool/notebooks/lab?path=tutorial%2Fc00_introduction.ipynb).

## Features

* Pure Python implementation using only the Standard Library. Run it almost anywhere Python runs: program locally, share Jupyter notebooks, or build your own client-side web apps using Pyodide.
* Dice support all standard operators (+, -, <, >, etc.) as well as an extensive library of functions (rerolling, exploding, etc.)
* Efficient dice pool algorithm can solve keep-highest, finding sets and/or straights, *RISK*-like mechanics, and more in milliseconds, even for large pools.
* Exact fractional probabilities using Python `int`s.
* Some support for decks (aka sampling without replacement).

## Installing

```
pip install icepool
```

The source is pure Python, so including a direct copy in your project can work as well.

## Versioning

Frankly, I haven't made backwards compatibility a top priority. If you need specific behavior, I recommend version pinning. Typing is especially unstable.

## Similar projects

In roughly chronological order:

### Troll by Torben Ægidius Mogensen

http://hjemmesider.diku.dk/~torbenm/Troll/

The oldest general-purpose dice probability calculator I know of. It has an accompanying peer-reviewed paper.

### AnyDice by Jasper Flick

https://anydice.com/

Probably the most popular dice probability calculator in existence, and with good reason---its accessibility and shareability remains unparalleled. I still use it often for prototyping and as a second opinion.

### SnakeEyes by Noé Falzon

https://snake-eyes.io/

SnakeEyes demonstrated the viability of browser-based, client-side dice calculation, as well as introducing me to [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/).

### dice_roll.py by Ilmari Karonen

https://gist.github.com/vyznev/8f5e62c91ce4d8ca7841974c87271e2f

This demonstrated the trick of iterating "vertically" over the outcomes of dice in a dice pool, rather than "horizontally" through the dice---one of the insights into creating a much faster dice pool algorithm.

### `dyce` by Matt Bogosian

https://github.com/posita/dyce

Another Python dice probability package. I've benefited greatly from exchanging our experiences.
