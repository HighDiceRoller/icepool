## Tips (JupyterLite)

* Your local edits are stored in your browser. Only you can see your local version.
* You can restore the original version of a file by "deleting" it.
* If you want to export an edited or new notebook, you'll need to right click on the file and select "Download".
* Try Contextual Help (Ctrl-I).
* Append "?room=my-room-name" to the URL, e.g. https://highdiceroller.github.io/icepool/notebooks/lab/index.html?room=my-room-name, for [real-time collaboration](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rtc/index.html).
