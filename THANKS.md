While I did not copy any of this code from other sources,
I did benefit from the following:

Jasper Flick's [AnyDice](https://anydice.com/) is the most popular
dice calculator in existence, and with good reason---its accessibility
remains unparalleled. I still use it often for quick prototyping and
as a second opinion.

No√© Falzon's [SnakeEyes](https://snake-eyes.io/) demonstrated the viability
of browser-based, client-side dice calculation, as well as introducing me to
[Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/).

In two StackExchange posts, Ilmari Karonen mentioned 
[iterating through outcomes](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/a/166663/72732)
and [memoization](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/a/194712/72732).
It turns out that these are key concepts in creating a flexible yet efficient
dice pool calculation.
