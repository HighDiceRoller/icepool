        The dice are sorted in ascending order for this purpose,
        regardless of which order the outcomes are evaluated in.

        This is always an absolute selection on all `size` dice,
        not a relative selection on already-selected dice,
        which would be ambiguous in the presence of multiple or negative counts.

        For example, here are some ways of selecting the two highest dice out of 5:

        * `pool[3:5]`
        * `pool[3:]`
        * `pool[-2:]`
        * `pool[..., 1, 1]`
        * `pool[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]`

        These will count the highest as a positive and the lowest as a negative:

        * `pool[-1, 0, 0, 0, 1]`
        * `pool[-1, ..., 1]`

        Args: One of the following:
            * An `int`. This will count only the `Die` at the specified index
                (once). In this case, the result will be a `Die`, not a `Pool`.
            * A `slice`. The selected dice are counted once each.
            * A sequence of one `int` for each `Die`.
                Each `Die` is counted that many times, which could be multiple or
                negative times.

                Up to one `...` (`Ellipsis`) may be used.
                `...` will be replaced with a number of zero
                counts depending on the size of the pool.
                This number may be "negative" if more `int`s are provided than
                the size of the `Pool`. Specifically:

                * If `sorted_roll_counts` is shorter than `size`, `...`
                    acts as enough zero counts to make up the difference.
                    E.g. `pool[1, ..., 1]` on five dice would act as `pool[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]`.
                * If `sorted_roll_counts` has length equal to `size`, `...` has no effect.
                    E.g. `pool[1, ..., 1]` on two dice would act as `pool[1, 1]`.
                * If `sorted_roll_counts` is longer than `size` and `...` is on one side,
                    elements will be dropped from `sorted_roll_counts` on the side with `...`.
                    E.g. `pool[..., 1, 2, 3]` on two dice would act as `pool[2, 3]`.
                * If `sorted_roll_counts` is longer than `size` and `...`
                    is in the middle, the counts will be as the sum of two
                    one-sided `...`.
                    E.g. `pool[-1, ..., 1]` acts like `[-1, ...]` plus `[..., 1]`.
                    On a `Pool` consisting of a single `Die` this would have
                    the -1 and 1 cancel each other out.
