        Use `pool[index]` for the same effect as this method.

        The rolls are sorted in ascending order for this purpose,
        regardless of which order the outcomes are evaluated in.

        For example, here are some ways of selecting the two highest rolls out
        of five:

        * `pool[3:5]`
        * `pool[3:]`
        * `pool[-2:]`
        * `pool[..., 1, 1]`
        * `pool[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]`

        These will count the highest as a positive and the lowest as a negative:

        * `pool[-1, 0, 0, 0, 1]`
        * `pool[-1, ..., 1]`

        The valid types of argument are:

        * An `int`. This will count only the roll at the specified index.
            In this case, the result is a `Die` rather than a `Pool`.
        * A `slice`. The selected dice are counted once each.
        * A sequence of one `int` for each `Die`.
            Each roll is counted that many times, which could be multiple or
            negative times.

            Up to one `...` (`Ellipsis`) may be used.
            `...` will be replaced with a number of zero
            counts depending on the size of the pool.
            This number may be "negative" if more `int`s are provided than
            the size of the `Pool`. Specifically:

            * If `index` is shorter than `size`, `...`
                acts as enough zero counts to make up the difference.
                E.g. `pool[1, ..., 1]` on five dice would act as
                `pool[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]`.
            * If `index` has length equal to `size`, `...` has no effect.
                E.g. `pool[1, ..., 1]` on two dice would act as `pool[1, 1]`.
            * If `index` is longer than `size` and `...` is on one side,
                elements will be dropped from `index` on the side with `...`.
                E.g. `pool[..., 1, 2, 3]` on two dice would act as `pool[2, 3]`.
            * If `index` is longer than `size` and `...`
                is in the middle, the counts will be as the sum of two
                one-sided `...`.
                E.g. `pool[-1, ..., 1]` acts like `[-1, ...]` plus `[..., 1]`.
                On a `Pool` consisting of a single `Die` this would have
                the -1 and 1 cancel each other out.

        If this is called more than once, the selection is applied relative
        to the previous keep_tuple. For example, applying `[:2][-1]` would
        produce the second-lowest roll.

        Raises:
            IndexError: If:
                * More than one `...` is used.
                * The current keep_tuple has negative counts.
