class OutcomeCountEval(ABC):
    """An abstract, immutable, callable class for evaulating one or more `OutcomeCountGens`s.

    There is one abstract method to implement: `next_state()`.
    This should incrementally calculate the result given one outcome at a time
    along with how many of that outcome were produced.
    An example sequence of calls, as far as `next_state()` is concerned, is:

    1. `state = next_state(state=None, outcome=1, count=how_many_1s)`
    2. `state = next_state(state, 2, how_many_2s)`
    3. `state = next_state(state, 3, how_many_3s)`
    4. `state = next_state(state, 4, how_many_4s)`
    5. `state = next_state(state, 5, how_many_5s)`
    6. `state = next_state(state, 6, how_many_6s)`
    7. `outcome = final_outcome(state, *gens)`

    A few other methods can optionally be overridden to further customize behavior.

    It is not expected that subclasses of `OutcomeCountEval`
    be able to handle arbitrary types or numbers of gens.
    Indeed, most are expected to handle only a fixed number of gens,
    and often even only gens with a particular type of die.

    Instances cache all intermediate state distributions.
    You should therefore reuse instances when possible.

    Instances should not be modified after construction
    in any way that affects the return values of these methods.
    Otherwise, values in the cache may be incorrect.

        This should produce a state given the previous state, an outcome,
        and the number that outcome produced by each gen.

        Within `eval()`, this will be called using only positional arguments.
        Thus, you may rename any of the arguments if you wish.

        Make sure to handle the base case where `state is None`.

        Args:
            state: A hashable object indicating the state before rolling the
                current outcome. If there was no previous outcome, this will be
                `None`.
            outcome: The current outcome.
                `next_state` will see all rolled outcomes in monotonic order;
                either ascending or descending depending on `direction()`.
                If there are multiple gens, the set of outcomes is the
                union of the outcomes of the invididual gens. All outcomes
                with nonzero  count will be visited. Outcomes with zero count
                may or may not be visited. If you need to enforce that certain

                `alignment()`.
            *counts: One `int` for each gen indicating how many of the current
                outcome were produced. If there are multiple
                gens, it's possible that some outcomes will not appear in
                all gens. In this case, the count for the gen(s)
                that do not have the outcome will be 0. Zero-weight outcomes
                count as having that outcome.

                Most subclasses will expect a fixed number of gens and

        Returns:
            A hashable object indicating the next state.
