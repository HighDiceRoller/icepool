        You can use `pool[count_dice]` for the same effect as this method.

        The dice are sorted in ascending order for this purpose,
        regardless of which order the outcomes are evaluated in.

        This is always an absolute selection on all `num_dice`,
        not a relative selection on already-selected dice,
        which would be ambiguous in the presence of multiple or negative counts.

        For example, here are some ways of selecting the two highest dice out of 5:

        * `pool[3:5]`
        * `pool[3:]`
        * `pool[-2:]`
        * `pool[..., 1, 1]`

        These will also select the two highest dice out of 5, and will also
        resize the pool to 5 dice first:

        * `pool[3::5]`
        * `pool[3:5:5]`
        * `pool[-2::5]`
        * `pool[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]`

        These will count the highest as a positive and the lowest as a negative:

        * `pool[-1, 0, 0, 0, 1]`
        * `pool[-1, ..., 1]`

        Args:
            `None`: All dice will be counted once.
            An `int`. This will count only the die at the specified index (once).
                In this case, the result will be a `Die`, not a pool.
            A `slice`. The selected dice are counted once each.
                If provided, the third argument resizes the pool,
                rather than being a step; however, this is only valid if the
                pool consists of a single type of die.
            A sequence of one `int` for each die.
                Each die is counted that many times, which could be multiple or
                negative times. This may resize the pool, but only if the
                pool consists of a single type of die.

                Up to one `Ellipsis` (`...`) may be used.
                If an `Ellipsis` is used, the size of the pool won't change.
                Instead, the `Ellipsis` will be replaced with a number of zero
                counts, sufficient to maintain the current size of this pool.
                This number may be "negative" if more `int`s are provided than
                the size of the pool. Specifically:

                * If `count_dice` is shorter than `num_dice`, the `Ellipsis`
                    acts as enough zero counts to make up the difference.
                    E.g. `pool[1, ..., 1]` on five dice would act as `pool[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]`.
                * If `count_dice` has length equal to `num_dice`, the `Ellipsis` has no effect.
                    E.g. `pool[1, ..., 1]` on two dice would act as `pool[1, 1]`.
                * If `count_dice` is longer than `num_dice` and the `Ellipsis` is on one side,
                    elements will be dropped from `count_dice` on the side with the `Ellipsis`.
                    E.g. `pool[..., 1, 2, 3]` on two dice would act as `pool[2, 3]`.
                * If `count_dice` is longer than `num_dice` and the `Ellipsis`
                    is in the middle, the counts will be as the sum of two
                    one-sided `Ellipsis`.
                    E.g. `pool[-1, ..., 1]` acts like `[-1, ...]` plus `[..., 1]`.
                    On a pool consisting of a single single die this would have
                    the -1 and 1 cancel each other out.

        Raises:
