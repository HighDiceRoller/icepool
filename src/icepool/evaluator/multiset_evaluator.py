        This should produce a state given the previous state, an outcome,
        the count of that outcome produced by each multiset input, and any
        **kwargs provided to `evaluate()`.

        `evaluate()` will always call this with `state, outcome, *counts` as
        positional arguments. Furthermore, there is no expectation that a 
        subclass be able to handle an arbitrary number of counts. 
        
        Thus, you are free to:
        * Rename `state` or `outcome` in a subclass.
        * Replace `*counts` with a fixed set of parameters.

        States must be hashable. At current, they do not have to be orderable.
        However, this may change in the future, and if they are not totally
        orderable, you must override `final_outcome` to create totally orderable
        final outcomes.

        Returning a `Die` is not supported.

        Args:
            state: A hashable object indicating the state before rolling the
                current outcome. If `initial_state()` is not overridden, the
                initial state is `None`.
            order: The order in which outcomes are seen. You can raise an 
                `UnsupportedOrder` if you don't want to support the current 
                order. In this case, the opposite order will then be attempted
                (if it hasn't already been attempted).
            outcome: The current outcome.
                If there are multiple inputs, the set of outcomes is at 
                least the union of the outcomes of the invididual inputs. 
                You can use `extra_outcomes()` to add extra outcomes.
            *counts: One value (usually an `int`) for each input indicating how
                many of the current outcome were produced. You may replace this
                with a fixed series of parameters.

        Returns:
            A hashable object indicating the next state.
            The special value `icepool.Reroll` can be used to immediately remove
            the state from consideration, effectively performing a full reroll.
