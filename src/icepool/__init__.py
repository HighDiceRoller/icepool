"""Package for computing dice and card probabilities.

Starting with `v0.25.1`, you can replace `latest` in the URL with an old version
number to get the documentation for that version.

See [this JupyterLite distribution](https://highdiceroller.github.io/icepool/notebooks/lab/index.html)
for examples.

General conventions:

* Instances are immutable (apart from internal caching). Anything that looks
    like it mutates an instance actually returns a separate instance with the
    change.
* Unless explictly specified otherwise, elements with zero quantity, rolls, etc.
    are considered.

Reroll: Final = RerollType.Reroll
"""Indicates that an outcome should be rerolled (with unlimited depth).

This can be used in place of outcomes in many places. See individual function
and method descriptions for details.

This effectively removes the outcome from the probability space, along with its
contribution to the denominator.

This can be used for conditional probability by removing all outcomes not
consistent with the given observations.

Operation in specific cases:

* When used with `Again`, only that stage is rerolled, not the entire `Again`
    tree.
* To reroll with limited depth, use `Die.reroll()`, or `Again` with no
    modification.
* When used with `MultisetEvaluator`, the entire evaluation is rerolled.

Again: Final = AgainExpression(is_additive=True)
"""A symbol indicating that the die should be rolled again, usually with some operation applied.

This is designed to be used with the `Die()` constructor.
`AgainExpression`s should not be fed to functions or methods other than
`Die()`, but it can be used with operators. Examples:

* `Again + 6`: Roll again and add 6.
* `Again + Again`: Roll again twice and sum.

The `again_count`, `again_depth`, and `again_end` arguments to `Die()`
affect how these arguments are processed. At most one of `again_count` or
`again_depth` may be provided; if neither are provided, the behavior is as
`again_depth=1.

For finer control over rolling processes, use e.g. `Die.map()` instead.

#### Count mode

When `again_count` is provided, we start with one roll queued and execute one 
roll at a time. For every `Again` we roll, we queue another roll.
If we run out of rolls, we sum the rolls to find the result. If the total number
of rolls (not including the initial roll) would exceed `again_count`, we reroll
the entire process, effectively conditioning the process on not rolling more
than `again_count` extra dice.

This mode only allows "additive" expressions to be used with `Again`, which
means that only the following operators are allowed:

* Binary `+`
* `n @ AgainExpression`, where `n` is a non-negative `int` or `Population`.

Furthermore, the `+` operator is assumed to be associative and commutative.
For example, `str` or `tuple` outcomes will not produce elements with a definite
order.

#### Depth mode

When `again_depth=0`, `again_end` is directly substituted
for each occurence of `Again`. For other values of `again_depth`, the result for
`again_depth-1` is substituted for each occurence of `Again`.

If `again_end=icepool.Reroll`, then any `AgainExpression`s in the final depth
are rerolled.

#### Rerolls

`Reroll` only rerolls that particular die, not the entire process. Any such
rerolls do not count against the `again_count` or `again_depth` limit.

If `again_end=icepool.Reroll`:
* Count mode: Any result that would cause the number of rolls to exceed
    `again_count` is rerolled.
* Depth mode: Any `AgainExpression`s in the final depth level are rerolled.
