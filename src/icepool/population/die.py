    Dice are immutable. Methods do not modify the `Die` in-place;
    rather they return a `Die` representing the result.

    It *is* (mostly) well-defined to have a `Die` with zero-quantity outcomes.
    These can be useful in a few cases, such as:

    * `MultisetEvaluator` will iterate through zero-quantity outcomes,
        rather than possibly skipping that outcome. (Though in most cases it's
        better to use `MultisetEvaluator.alignment()`.)
    * `icepool.align()` and the like are convenient for making dice share the
        same set of outcomes.

    However, zero-quantity outcomes have a computational cost like any other
    outcome. Unless you have a specific use case in mind, it's best to leave
    them out.

    Most operators and methods will not introduce zero-quantity outcomes if
    their arguments do not have any; nor remove zero-quantity outcomes.

    It's also possible to have "empty" dice with no outcomes at all,
    though these have little use other than being sentinel values.

        Don't confuse this with `d()`:

        * `Die([6])`: A `Die` that always rolls the `int` 6.
        * `d(6)`: A d6.

        Also, don't confuse this with `Pool()`:

        * `Die([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])`: A d6.
        * `Pool([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])`: A `Pool` of six dice that always rolls one
            of each number.

        Here are some different ways of constructing a d6:

        * Just import it: `from icepool import d6`
        * Use the `d()` function: `icepool.d(6)`
        * Use a d6 that you already have: `Die(d6)` or `Die([d6])`
        * Mix a d3 and a d3+3: `Die([d3, d3+3])`
        * Use a dict: `Die({1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 6:1})`
        * Give the faces as a sequence: `Die([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])`

        All quantities must be non-negative, though they can be zero.

        Several methods and functions foward **kwargs to this constructor.
        However, these only affect the construction of the returned or yielded
        dice. Any other implicit conversions of arguments or operands to dice
        will be done with the default keyword arguments.

        EXPERIMENTAL: Use `icepool.Again` to roll the dice again, usually with
        some modification. For example,

        ```
        Die([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 + Again])
        ```

        would be an exploding d6. Use the `again_depth` parameter to control
        the maximum depth. `again_depth` does not apply to `Reroll`.

        If the roll reaches the maximum depth, the `again_end` is used instead
        of rolling again. Options for `again_end` include:

        * No value (`None`), which will attempt to determine a zero value from
            the outcomes that don't involve `Again`.
        * A single outcome, or a `Die`.
        * `Reroll`, which will reroll any end roll involving `Again`.
        * You could also consider some sort of placeholder value such as
            `math.inf`.

        Denominator: For a flat set of outcomes, the denominator is just the
        sum of the corresponding quantities. If the outcomes themselves have
        secondary denominators, then the overall denominator is the primary
        denominator times the LCM of the outcome denominators.

        For example, `Die([d3, d4, d6])` has a final denominator of 36: 3 for
        the primary selection between the three secondary dice, times 12 for
        the LCM of 3, 4, and 6.

        Args:
            outcomes: The faces of the `Die`. This can be one of the following:
                * A `Sequence` of outcomes. Duplicates will contribute
                    quantity for each appearance.
                * A `Mapping` from outcomes to quantities.

                Individual outcomes can each be one of the following:

                * An outcome, which must be hashable and totally orderable.
                * A `Die`, which will be flattened into the result.
                    The quantity assigned to a `Die` is shared among its
                    outcomes. The total denominator will be scaled up if
                    necessary.
                * `icepool.Reroll`, which will drop itself from consideration.
                * EXPERIMENTAL: `icepool.Again`. See the main text for
                    explanation.
            times: Multiplies the quantity of each element of `outcomes`.
                `times` can either be a sequence of the same length as
                `outcomes` or a single `int` to apply to all elements of
                `outcomes`.
